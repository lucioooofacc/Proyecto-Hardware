                Minecraft is a game where everything is made of blocks, but those blocks let you create entire worlds. At first, it looks simple (trees, dirt, stone, animals) but once you start playing, you realize how endless it actually is. You can explore giant caves, build huge castles, survive the night against zombies and skeletons, or just relax farming and decorating your little house. <br><br>
                What makes Minecraft special is the freedom. There's no single way to play it. Some people focus on adventure, gearing up to fight the Ender Dragon, while others spend hours designing cities, machines, or pixel art. It's almost like a mix of survival, creativity, and imagination all in one. <br><br>
                And honestly, that's why it's still so popular after all these years. Every world feels personal, every creation feels like yours, and you always end up finding something new to do. For us, it's not just a game it's like a sandbox where you can build your own story, block by block.

                Is one of the most influential video games ever created. It was first developed in 2009 by Markus Persson, known as Notch, who began working on a simple block-based building game. The concept was unique: players could explore a world made entirely of blocks, break them, and place them again to create their own structures and environments.<br><br>
                Over time, new features were added, such as Survival Mode, where players must gather resources and face hostile creatures like zombies, skeletons, and the now iconic Creeper. Other major additions included the Nether dimension, the End dimension with the Ender Dragon, and later updates that introduced new biomes, animals, and mechanics.
                The game was officially released in 2011, but it had already gained enormous popularity through its community and content creators on platforms like YouTube. Videos, music parodies, and “Let's Plays” helped Minecraft become a cultural phenomenon.<br><br>
                In 2014, Mojang, the studio behind the game, was acquired by Microsoft for 2.5 billion dollars. While this sparked some concerns among fans, the game continued to grow. Since then, it has received numerous updates, introducing features such as bees, axolotls, the Warden, and caves and cliffs that completely changed world generation
                Today, Minecraft is the bestselling videogame in history. It is available on nearly every platform, from computers to consoles and even mobile devices. Beyond being a game, it has become a space for creativity, education, and community, inspiring millions of players worldwide.<br><br>
                For us, as teenagers who have grown up playing Minecraft, it is more than just entertainment. It is a part of our generation's culture. It has given us countless memories of building, exploring, and sometimes being unexpectedly defeated by a Creeper. We truly believe that Minecraft will continue to inspire future players just as much as it has inspired us.

    <p style="color:black; background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.527); border-radius:5px; padding:4px; display:inline-block;">Minecraft offers a wide range of content that shapes how players explore, build, and survive. From creatures and environments to building blocks and regular updates, each part adds to the endless possibilities of the game.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:left; color:#1e8830; background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.527); border-radius:5px; padding:4px; display:inline-block;">Mobs</h2>
    <p style="color:black; background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.527); border-radius:5px; padding:4px; margin-right: 750px;">Mobs are living entities that can be friendly, neutral, or hostile. <br>Friendly: cows, pigs, villagers, axolotls. <br> Neutral: endermen, wolves, bees. <br> Hostile: zombies, skeletons, creepers, the Ender Dragon. <br> Each mob has unique behaviors that affect gameplay, such as trading, farming, or fighting.</p>

                   <img src="https://github.com/lucioooofacc/Proyecto-Software/blob/main/biomesyeah.png?raw=true" alt="biomes of minecraft" style="width:700px; height:350px; margin-right: 20px; float:right;">

Think of them as the “flavors” of the game: each one has its own look, its own animals, and even its own personality.<br> Plains: Wide open and peaceful, the perfect place to build your first home. Cows, sheep, and horses wander around like neighbors waiting to be adopted.<br> Forest: Packed with trees, great for collecting wood. If you're lucky, you'll run into wolves you can tame and call your companions.<br> Desert: Hot and dangerous, but it hides secrets. Desert temples are like treasure chests waiting to be cracked open. Sand also becomes glass, so the desert is more useful than it looks.<br> Taiga: Cold, snowy forests with foxes and wolves sneaking around. The atmosphere here feels cozy and wild at the same time.<br> Jungle: Thick, wild, and full of surprises. Youll find parrots, ocelots, and massive temples hidden in the vines. It's beautiful, but tricky to survive in.<br> Swamp: Muddy, dark, and spooky. Slimes hop around and witches brew potions in huts (definitely not a place to settle down)<br> Ocean: Endless blue stretching in every direction. Shipwrecks, guardians, and treasure chests lie hidden beneath the waves.<br> Nether Biomes: Basalt Deltas, Crimson Forests, Warped Forests… the Nether is like Minecraft's version of the underworld. It's terrifying, fiery, and rewarding if you know how to survive.<br> The End: A surreal, empty void where floating islands hold End Cities and, of course, the Ender Dragon (the game's ultimate boss)<br> Biomes aren't just scenery; they decide what resources you'll get, how mobs behave, and what kind of adventure you'll have.</p>

Everything you see—land, buildings, even enemies—is made of them. They’re like digital Lego pieces you can use to create anything you imagine.<br><br>
Players use blocks to:<br>
Build: From tiny huts to entire kingdoms.<br>
Craft: Tools, armor, weapons, and machines.<br>
Decorate: Bright wool, colored terracotta, shiny glass—you name it.<br><br>
Some special blocks worth knowing:<br>
Obsidian: The toughest block you’ll need for Nether portals.<br>
Diamond Block: Rare, shiny, and the ultimate bragging rights.<br>
Bedrock: Unbreakable in survival—literally the game’s foundation.<br>
Redstone: Minecraft’s electricity. It lets you build doors, traps, elevators, and even working computers if you’re creative enough.</p>
